1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

As of now, most of our work focuses on using existing code/repo for replication and learning about some of the potential approaches to our capstone project. Some topics that I found interesting are training a model from scratch/hyper-parameter tuning using Weights and Biases.

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.  

A potential investigation that might be suitable for our capstone project might be modification based on an existing model. For example, we can modify the architecture of an existing model to see if there can be an improvement.

3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?  

As we're primarily focusing on replicating existing work. I think it would also be beneficial if there's some discussion/lesson on how we can code these specific architectures ourselves. I feel like it would be great as we can build some foundation in preparation for the Quarter 2 project.

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?  

Some other techniques that I would be interested in using would be methods such as architectural modifications such as attention mechanism variants that can potentially improve model performance under a strict data constraint. Another potential technique that I'm also interested in would be combining specific architectures (such as GPT-BERT from previous submission) as a hybrid approach to check if there will be a better result.
